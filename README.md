# colorproject2000
a python program that changes colors in images

This program is not incredibly interesting
It allows you to take an image and click on any of the colors in the image and then change all of that color to another color.
For some reason though, the function that determines where you've clicked isnt very accurate though.
So it's kind of just a funny picture maker with no good use

You can choose to save the images at the end of the program.
Enjoy
